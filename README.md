## Instructional Philosophy

The materials in this repository are built around the following principles:

* **Engineering Design Process First** – AI is introduced as a tool within structured problem solving, not as a shortcut.
* **Scaffolded Complexity** – Concepts evolve from foundational design thinking to advanced analytical reasoning.
* **Ethical AI Integration** – Students are taught to question, verify, and responsibly apply AI-generated content.
* **Process Over Product** – Emphasis is placed on documentation, iteration, and reflective thinking.
